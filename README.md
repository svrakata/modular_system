## ?? QUESTIONS ??

Q: Is TS bloating the production code after being once compiled to plain JS and then BABELIZED ? 
A: NO. TS now works with babel and is directly compiled to X-browser code. Further more BABEL optimize the code increasing the performance.

Q: What's the point of using TS?
A: Less error prone, easy to read even by programmers coming from different languages and techs.
